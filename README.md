 Even after reading through the [GitHub Actions Matrix docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/running-variations-of-jobs-in-a-workflow), it can still be tough to imagine exactly what the results of a matrix will be, specifically when mixing and matching various includes and excludes.

 This tool attempts to help that process. Just paste the contents of your actions matrix into the editor and you can see the output jobs in realtime.
